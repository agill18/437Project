            The primary goal of the Cal Poly Animation club is to create animated short films that are then submitted to film
            festivals as well as hosting our own festival at the end of the year. We encourage students to jump in anywhere in the
            creative process (no experience needed) whether it be concept art, storyboarding, script writing, 2D animation, 3D
            animation, 3D modeling, rigging, texturing, lighting, video editing, and more. Sign up for our newsletter for more info
            or contact us to join today!
